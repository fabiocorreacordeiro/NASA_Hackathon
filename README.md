In the history of mankind the birth of agriculture marks the moment when we pass from hunters and begin to "cultivate the soil." But in subsoil we continue in the "extractive" stage and we still not using the subsoil for "cultivation". 
But what would this idea of subsoil cultivation be?

### The proposal is to rethink the use of the subsoil not only with an extractive way but with a "cultivation" approach. The project intent to inject urban waste and "cultivate" biogas while the water has been cleaned.

That is, to use the subsoil as huge "fixed bed (bio)reactors" where would occur, in a controlled way, chemical or biochemical processes for the production of materials of commercial interest. The "cultivation" can be done in the sandstones. Sandstones, which are "porous" geological formations, can accumulate fluids (liquids or gases). Aquifers and oil reservoirs are well-known examples. In these porous spaces, chemical and/or biochemical reactions may occur.

A well-known example of porous bioprocesses in the petroleum industry is the phenomenon of "biogenic acidification" in reservoirs. Bacterias present in the reservoir, in the presence of water containing sulfate ions and carbon (petroleum), metabolize hydrocarbons for energy and growth, and convert sulphate to sulphide, generating a series of problems in the production of petroleum.

A fixed bed bioreactor can be defined as a compact compartment filled with particles, through which a fluid (liquid or gas) flows vertically (upward or downward) or horizontally. During the flow of the fluid(s) may occur chemical or biochemical reactions between components.

This type of system can be operated in batch or continuous mode. The cultivation could be done by the injection of chemical, biological catalysts (enzymes) or microorganisms. In the industrial plants, this reactions can be done in a volume of cubic meters. In the other hands, natural geological formations would allow the use of compartments with volumes of the order of cubic kilometers with stable temperature.
